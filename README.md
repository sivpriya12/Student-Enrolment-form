# Student Enrollment Form

## Description
This project features a web-based student enrollment form designed to handle the entry, updating, and management of student data. The form allows users to enter and manage details such as roll number, full name, class, birth date, address, and enrollment date. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses jQuery for dynamic field updates and Bootstrap for styling. 

The core functionality includes:
- **Add New Student**: Input a new roll number and other details, then save the data.
- **Update Existing Student**: Retrieve and modify details of an existing student based on their roll number.
- **Reset Form**: Clear all fields and reset the form to its initial state.
- **Validation**: Ensure that all required fields are filled before saving or updating data.

The project currently simulates data handling with JavaScript functions and does not connect to a real database. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations in a form-based web application.
